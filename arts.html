      <p>Arts stream offers numerous career options and opportunities to students. It is a very traditional stream. This is one of the main reasons why this stream still has got takers in India! This stream is made up of parts like humanities, visual
        arts, performing arts, literary arts etc.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As mentioned before, arts stream is very diverse. This fact is evident from the studies involved in this stream. It covers wide variety of studies such as- visual arts (painting, sculpting, drawing etc), performing arts (music, dance, drama
        etc), literary arts (languages, literature, philosophy etc), history, law, humanities subjects, geography, political science etc.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the availability of such diverse areas of studies, career options associated with this field is equally impressive. After completing 12th Arts stream, students will have access to numerous professional courses focusing on areas
        like visual arts, law, performing arts, languages, management etc.</p>
      <p>There’s a misconception regarding this stream among Indian students and parents. Many of them think that arts stream is only taken by students who are academically dull. Well, this fact is false! There exists many challenging subjects in
        this stream too, and it takes certain aptitude to perform well in its exams too! It is very much possible to build a rewarding career after pursuing science stream at PUC level! In fact, many subjects present in arts stream will help one
        prepare well for Civil Services examination.</p>

    <h3>ARTS STREAM BOARDS
      <br>AVAILABLE IN INDIA
    </h3>
    <div class="arts-p2">
      <p>There are four main education boards available in India. Students may choose a stream that suits them best. The choice shall be made on the basis of difficulty level associated with the boards and aptitude of the student. The names of the
        boards are-</p>
      <ul class="courses">
        <li>CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)</li>
        <li>ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)</li>
        <li>IB (International Baccalaureate)</li>
        <li>State Boards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>IB is the toughest board among the above mentioned entries. It focuses on the concept of ‘how to learn’. Much emphasis is laid on ‘application of knowledge’ and ‘practical aspects’ of learning.</p>
      <p>IB board is followed by ICSE board, when it comes to difficulty level. Then comes CBSE board. I think most of you are knowledgeable about this board. It functions under the Union Government of India. Difficulty level associated with this
        board is moderate.</p>
      <p>Last comes State Boards. Each State in India has its own education board. It functions under the respective State Governments of each state. Language of instruction (medium) in case of schools affiliated to such boards are- regional language
        and English.</p>
