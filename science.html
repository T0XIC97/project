      <p>Science stream is a very popular choice among 10th standard passed students in India. Students who want to pursue pure and applied science professional courses in the future may choose this stream.</p>
      <p>When compared to other main streams- Commerce and Arts, Science stream is a bit tough. Academically bright students won’t have much difficulty in facing the subjects present in this stream though. Let us take a look at the important
        education boards available in India (11th and 12th Science stream).</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3>SCIENCE STREAM BOARDS
      <br>AVAILABLE IN INDIA
    </h3>
    <div class="science-p2">
      <p>There are four main education boards available in India. Students may choose a stream that suits them best. The choice shall be made on the basis of difficulty level associated with the boards and aptitude of the student. The names of the
        boards are-</p>
      <ul class="courses">
        <li>CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education)</li>
        <li>ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education)</li>
        <li>IB (International Baccalaureate)</li>
        <li>State Boards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>IB is the toughest board among the above mentioned entries. It focuses on the concept of ‘how to learn’. Much emphasis is laid on ‘application of knowledge’ and ‘practical aspects’ of learning.</p>
      <p>IB board is followed by ICSE board, when it comes to difficulty level. Then comes CBSE board. I think most of you are knowledgeable about this board. It functions under the Union Government of India. Difficulty level associated with this
        board is moderate.</p>
      <p>Last comes State Boards. Each State in India has its own education board. It functions under the respective State Governments of each state. Language of instruction (medium) in case of schools affiliated to such boards are- regional language
        and English.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="group">
      <h4>SCIENCE STREAM GROUPS</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="science-p3">
      <p>When it comes to Science stream, there are two main groups within it. They are-</p>
      <ul class="stream">
        <li> <strong>Biology Group (Physics, Chemistry and Biology as main subjects)</strong></li>
        <li> <strong>Mathematics Group (Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics subjects)</strong></li>
        <br>
        <p>These groups, to an extent, ends up determining the career path of a student! A student may choose any one of the above mentioned groups or pursue both of them at the same time. The choice has to be made by the student.</p>
      </ul>
      <p>Let us now focus on the important subjects present in science stream schooling.</p>
      <ul class="subjects">
        <li>Physics</li>
        <li>Chemistry </li>
        <li>Mathematics </li>
        <li>Biology</li>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Among the above mentioned subjects, Physics, Chemistry, English and Mathematics/Biology are compulsory subjects. Students have to choose an optional subject other than them. Usually, availability of such optional subjects may vary from one
        board to another and from one state board to another. Usually, the optional subjects are- computer science, Sanskrit, regional languages etc.</p>
